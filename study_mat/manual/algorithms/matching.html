<h1>2.8. Matching</h1>

<hr />
<h2><a id="what">What is matching?</a></h2>


<p>
Matching is a particular type of problem in <a href="graphs.html">graph
theory</a>. The idea is to find pairs of vertices joined by edges, so that
no vertex is in more than one pair and so that something is minimised or
maximised.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="cardinalbipartite">Cardinal Bipartite Matching</a></h2>


<p>
The simplest type of matching is cardinal bipartite matching. In this
problem the given graph is bipartite and the number of pairs must be
maximised. Usually there are the same number of vertices in each part of the
graph, but not always. This type of problem usually takes the form of
assigning the member of one group (e.g. cows) to another (e.g. farmers).
</p>

<p>
The algorithm is based on starting with an arbitrary set of pairs and then
repeatedly increasing the number of pairs. The initial set can be build by
looping through the vertices in one part of the graph and attempting to find
matches for them in the other side of the graph. The process for increasing
the number of pairs is chosen in such a way that when it will only fail when
an optimum matching has been found.
</p>

<p>
The process is very similar to a <a href="graphs.html#shortest">shortest
path</a> algorithm. Label the two parts of the graph part A and part B.
Start with any unmatched vertex in A, say X. Then perform a breadth first
search, as if trying to construct the shortest path from X to every other
vertex in the graph. The exception is that from vertices in A you may only
use edges not in the matching, and from vertices in B you may only use edges
in the matching (so from a vertex in B you may only go to its partner in A).
The search terminates once an unmatched vertex in B is reached or no new
vertices can be reached (the queue is empty).
</p>

<p>
If an unmatched vertex in B (say Y) has been reached then there is a path
from X to Y using only edges of the specified type (called an
<em>augmenting</em> path). Suppose the path is X
-&gt; B1 -&gt; A1 -&gt; B2 -&gt; A2 -&gt; ... -&gt; Bk -&gt; Ak -&gt; Y,
were (Ai, Bi) is a pair for every i. Remove all these pairs and make new
pairs (X, B1), (A1, B2), (A2, B3), ..., (Ak, Y). There is one more pair than
there was before, so the number of pairs has increased.
</p>

<p>
If there is any way to increase the number of pairs then this algorithm will
find it for some X (so cycle through the X's). To see this, consider
overlaying a non-optimal and an optimal pairing using XOR's (i.e. edges only
appear in the overlay if they were matches in exactly one of the original
matchings). It shouldn't be too hard to convince yourself that this new
graph will contain a path of exactly the type for which the algorithm
searches.
</p>

<p>
It is actually more efficient to start the search from all unmatched edges
in A by inserting them all into the queue at the beginning.
</p>

<p>
This algorithm is O(VE), where V is the number of vertices and E the number
of edges, if the correct data structures are used. This is because each
iteration takes O(maxV,E) steps (O(V) for preprocessing and postprocessing
and O(E) for the actual breadth first search), and the maximum number of
iterations is O(minV,E) because the number of pairs cannot exceed the
number of edges or vertices.
