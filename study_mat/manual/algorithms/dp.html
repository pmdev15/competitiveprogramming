<h1>2.3. Dynamic programming</h1>

<hr />
<h2><a id="what">What is dynamic programming?</a></h2>


<p>
Dynamic programming is not a specific algorithm, but rather a
programming technique (like recursion). It is best described as
creating solutions to large problems by combining solutions to smaller
problems. On some problems, applying dynamic programming can change the
<a href="efficiency.html">efficiency</a> from exponential to
polynomial.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="example">An example</a></h2>


<p>
Consider the problem of computing the Nth Fibonacci number F(N). The
Fibonacci sequence starts 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ..., with each number being
the sum of the previous two. So a simple recursive implementation might
look like this:
</p>
<pre>
function fib(n : integer) : integer;
begin
  if n &lt;= 2 then fib := 1
  else fib := fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
end;
</pre>

<p>
That is all well and good, but how efficienct is it? It turns out to
take time proportional to the <em>answer</em>, which is in fact
exponential time (<tt>O(s<sup>n</sup>)</tt>, where <tt>s</tt> is the
golden ratio). This example is usually used to show the pitfalls of
recursion, but also provides a simple example of converting a problem
to dynamic programming.
</p>

<p>
The key observation is that the recursive function is a true
function in the mathematical sense: it has no side effects, and the
output depends only on the input <tt>n</tt>. This means that we don't
have to start by asking for the Nth Fibonacci number and work
downwards, but can start with the first one and work upwards. Here is
the code (<tt>arr</tt> is an array that is assumed to be big enough):
</p>
<pre>
function fib(n : integer) : integer;
var
  i : integer;
begin
  arr[1] := 1;
  arr[2] := 1;
  for i := 3 to n do
    arr[i] := arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2];
  fib := arr[n];
end;
</pre>
<p>
This computes the smaller problems of finding F(1), F(2), F(3) and so
on, and combines these to produce the answers to the bigger problem of
finding F(n).
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="general">The general approach</a></h2>


<p>
Identifying problems that can be solving with dynamic programming is
something that comes with practice. To begin with, the following
procedure will help you see the dynamic programming solutions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a recursive solution to the problem.</li>
<li>Modify the recursive function until it becomes a mathematical
function. That is, it must have no side effect and the answer must
depend only on the parameters. It may also depend on global variables
but these must be static input data, not variables that change over the
course of the program. If you cannot modify the recursion to do this,
then it is possible that the problem cannot be solved with dynamic
programming.</li>
<li>Try to reduce the number of parameters as much as possible. If
there are parameters that are the same for the entire program, make
them global variables. If there are parameters that can be calculated
from other parameters, remove them.</li>
<li>Create an array (possibly multi-dimensional) whose indices
correspond to the parameters of the recursive function. The array
should be able to hold the answer for every possible call to the
function.</li>
<li>Work out what dependencies are used in the recursive function. In the
Fibonacci example, F(n) depends on F(n - 1) and F(n - 2).</li>
<li>Write nested loops to loop over all possible inputs to the
function, up to the inputs you actually want. Organise the loops so
that dependencies are satisfied (e.g. so that F(n - 1) and F(n - 2) are
computed before they are needed to compute F(n)). For each set of
inputs, compute the output and store it into the array. Do not call the
recursive function but rather get the answer from the array.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h2><a id="memory">Saving memory</a></h2>


<p>
Sometimes the parameter space (the set of all legal input parameters)
is too large to store in an array. This will usually happen if there
are several parameters. To get around this, it is sometimes possible to
get around this by only storing a subset of the parameter space (this
depends on the problem). To return to the Fibonacci problem, we see
that we only need to keep the last two Fibonacci numbers, as the
previous ones are never used again. The modified code is:
</p>
<pre>
function fib(n : integer) : integer;
var
  f1, f2, cur, i : integer;
begin
  f1 := 1;
  f2 := 1;
  cur := 1;
  for i := 3 to n do
  begin
    f1 := f2;
    f2 := cur;
    cur := f1 + f2;
  end;
  fib := cur;
end;
</pre>
<p>
More generally, the array will have multiple dimensions, and sometimes
only one or two "rows" of the array are needed at one time. These cases
can be identitied from the dependencies: in the Fibonacci example, F(n)
depends only on the previous two elements, so those are all that need
to be kept.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="memoise">Memoisation</a></h2>


<p>
Sometimes the dependencies in problems are rather complicated, and this
can make the ordering of the loops rather tricky. This often arises in
problems involving <a href="graphs.html">graphs</a>, where the
dependencies are edges in the graph. Another problem with writing loops
is that it is sometimes more efficient to avoid solving sub-problems
that are never actually used to solve the main problem.
</p>

<p>
Both of these problems are addressed by a technique known as
<em>memoisation</em> or <em>caching</em>. It is equivalent to dynamic
programming, but I find it to be more work and generally only implement
it when these problems arise. The basic approach is to stop after step
4 in the process above, leaving you with a recursive function and an
array for holding the outputs. Initially tag all the array elements to
indicate that they have not been computed (e.g. by storing -1). Then
modify the recursive function to return the array value if it has
already been computed, and to do the work otherwise. The array thus
acts as a <em>cache</em> of results that have already been computed.
Reusing the Fibonacci example:
</p>
<pre>
var
   cache : array[1..MAXN] of longint;

procedure initialise;
begin
     fill cache with -1's, indicating that the value isn't known
     fillchar(cache, sizeof(cache), 255); 
     if we initialise the first 2 here, it simplies the real function
     cache[1] := 1;
     cache[2] := 1;
end;

function fib(n : integer) : integer;
begin
     if (cache[n] = -1) then
       cache[n] := fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
     fib := cache[n];
end;
</pre>
