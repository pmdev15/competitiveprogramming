<h1>5.3. Evaluation</h1>

<p>Nowdays, most algorithm contests are evaluated using automatic
grading software that takes care of the details of putting the right
files in the right place at the right time, enforcing constraints and
security, summarising scores and so on. For conventional problems, the
problem author can be blissfully unaware of the inner workings, but in
some cases it is necessary to be familiar with the limitations of
whichever grading system is used.</p>

<p>The first question is whether there is to be a single correct
answer. The advantage of a single correct answer is that it is easy to
evaluate, as it need only be compared to the model answer, and the
grading system may well automate this. The disadvantage is that a
single number in the output (or worse, a yes/no response) may be
correctly returned even by a broken program, or one that is guessing.
In a contest such as TopCoder, where one gets a question completely
right or not at all, this is not a major problem, but for other
contests like the IOI, it can cause marks to be higher than they
should. In some cases this can be avoided by requiring a more detailed
output file, with some tiebreaker rule to ensure a unique correct
answer. The advantage of a more complete output file is that it is
easier to prove that a contestant is wrong and provide helpful
feedback, such as indicating illegal moves made.</p>

<p>You should also keep in mind that it is standard practice to have a
single input source and a single output sink, and the SACO grading
system does not support more. If you have, for example, a separate
dictionary, it should be merged into the single input file.</p>

<p>Reactive or online tasks (in which the contestants' programs
communicate with an opponent or grader) have their own pitfalls.
Assuming the grader runs in a separate process (which is good
practice), every time control passes from one to the other, there is a
flush and a process context switch. Some of this time will be charged
to the contestant's program, and it can quickly dominate the overall
running time. It is also necessary to make the reactive grader
extremely robust to weird input from the contestant's program.</p>
