<h1>2.5. Searching</h1>

<p>
If you know you are going to need to search for an item in a set, you will
need to think carefully about what type of data structure you will use for
that set. At school level, the only searches that get mentioned are for
sorted and unsorted arrays. However, these are not the only data types that
are useful for searching.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="linear">Linear search</a></h2>


<p>
Start at the beginning of the list and check every element of the list. Duh.
Very slow (order <tt>O(n)</tt>) but works on an unsorted list.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="binary">Binary search</a></h2>


<p>
This is used for searching in a sorted array. Test the middle element of the
array. If it is too big, repeat the process in the left half of the array,
and the right half if it's too small. In this way, the amount of space that
needs to be searched is halved every time, so the time is <tt>O(log n)</tt>.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="hash">Hash search</a></h2>


<p>
Searching a <a href="../structures/hash.html">hash table</a> is easy and
extremely fast: Just find the hash value for the item you're looking for,
then go to that index and start searching the array until you find what
you're looking for or you hit a blank spot. The order is pretty close to <tt>O(1)</tt>, 
depending on how full your hash table is.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="binarytree">Binary tree search</a></h2>


<p>
Searching a binary tree is just as easy as searching a hash table, but it is
usually slower (especially if the tree is badly unbalanced). Just start at
the root, then go down the left subtree if the root is too big and the right
subtree if it is too small. Repeat until you find what you want or the
subtree you want isn't there. The running time is <tt>O(log n)</tt> on
average and <tt>O(n)</tt> in the worst case.
