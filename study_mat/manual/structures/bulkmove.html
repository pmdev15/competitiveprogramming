<h1>1.5. Bulk move queues</h1>

<p>
A bulk move queue is a particular implementation of a <a
href="queue.html">queue</a>. It is not quite as efficient as a <a
href="circular.html">circular queue</a> and uses much more memory, but this
is made up for by its simplicity.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="implementation">How does it work?</a></h2>


<p>
It works very much like a <a href="circular.html">circular queue</a>, except
that it doesn't "wrap around". Instead, you make the array much bigger
than the maximum number of items in the queue. When you run out of room at
the end of the array, you move the entire contents of the queue back to the
front of the array (this is the "bulk move" from which the structure gets
its name).
</p>

<p>
Insertion and deletion are very simple. To insert, write the element to the
tail index and increment the tail. To delete, save the head element and
increment the head. If after an insertion the tail points beyond the end of
the array, then do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the contents of the queue to the front of the array (I recommend
the <code><a href="../pascal/copying.html#move">move</a></code> procedure in
Pascal or the <code>memcpy</code> function in C, rather than doing it
manually).</li>
<li>Set the head pointer to the new head of the queue and the new tail
pointer to the new tail of the queue.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note if the queue occupies more than half the array, then you must be
careful that you don't overwrite the frontmost queue elements before they
are copied because the old and new queue will overlap (and
<code>memcpy</code> doesn't allow overlap - use <code>memmove</code> in this
case).
