<h1>2.4. Sorting</h1>

<p>
Sorting a list of items is a major topic that I can't even begin to deal
with here (thick books have been written on the subject). I'm just going to
mention a few sorting algorithms and their characteristics.
</p>

<p>
In terms of performance, sorts mostly come in three flavours:
</p>

<ol>
<li><tt>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</tt></li>
<li><tt>O(n.log n)</tt> on average, but <tt>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</tt> at worst</li>
<li><tt>O(n.log n)</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>
The first class shouldn't be used for sorting really big arrays, say bigger
than 2000 (there is no real limit; it depends on your time constraints).
However they are usually very quick to code and debug, so always consider
using them unless you are sure that they won't cut it. The algorithms
in the second class are very seldom <tt>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</tt>, so it is
fine to use them in most applications, particularly in computer
olympiads where you only have 5 or 10 test cases and are highly
unlikely to get a really slow case, and even if you do you only lose
some of your points. These algorithms can actually be faster than those
in the third class because they are simpler.
</p>

<p>
Each of the sorts below has a description of the algorithm, the efficiency,
pros and cons and other notes. 
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="bubble">Bubble sort</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
Scan through the array from left to right, comparing adjacent elements.
Whenever two adjacent elements are out of order, swap them. Repeat this
until the array is sorted.
</dd>

<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
<tt>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</tt>
</dd>

<dt>Pros</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Simple to implement and understand, but not much more so than several
more efficient sorts</li>
<li>Will be very quick on an already sorted list</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Cons</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Probably the slowest sort ever invented</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
Don't bother learning this sort. There are other sorts which are just as
easy to implement and much faster. Although there are some time saving
modifications that can be made (e.g. keeping track of the last swap in the
previous pass, and only going up to there in the current pass), they aren't
worth it.
</dd>
</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a id="selection">Selection sort</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
Search the array for the largest element, and swap it with the element at
the end. Then repeat for just the first <tt>n - 1</tt> elements, then for
the first <tt>n - 2</tt> etc. This extracts the elements individually in
reverse order.
</dd>

<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
<tt>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</tt>
</dd>

<dt>Pros</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Cons</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Is no faster on a partially sorted array</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
This is a reasonable sort to use for sorting a fairly small number of
items, and my personal favourite of the O(n<sup>2</sup>) sorts.
</dd>
</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a id="insertion">Insertion sort</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
The first part of the list is sorted and the remainder is unsorted. To begin
with, all elements are in the unsorted part. Go through the elements in the
unsorted part sequencially and insert each into the sorted part by searching
for it's correct position with a <a href="searching.html#linear">linear
search</a> or a <a href="searching.html#binary">binary search</a>.
</dd>

<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
<tt>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</tt>
</dd>

<dt>Pros</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Fairly easy to implement with a linear search</li>
<li>If a backwards linear search is used, it is much faster on an partially
sorted array</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Cons</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>On an array, insertion is slow because all the elements after it have to
be moved up.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
This sort isn't especially useful by itself (although it is a
respectable O(n<sup>2</sup>) sort), but forms the basis of
<a href="#shell">Shell sort</a>.
</dd>
</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a id="shell">Shell sort</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
Consider the sequence 1, 4, 13, 40, 121 etc, where each term is triple
the previous one plus one. Go through the sequence backwards, starting
with the largest term less than the number of items being sorted. For
each member of the sequence <tt>g</tt>, do the following

<ul>
<li>Sort the elements with indices <tt>1, 1 + g, 1 + 2g, 1 + 3g ...</tt></li>
<li>Sort the elements with indices <tt>2, 2 + g, 2 + 2g, 2 + 3g ...</tt></li>
<li>Sort the elements with indices <tt>3, 3 + g, 3 + 2g, 3 + 3g ...</tt></li>
<li>And so on, up to <tt>g, 2g, 3g, 4g, ...</tt></li>
</ul>

Each of these sorts should be done with a sort that works quickly on a
partially sorted list; a good choice is <a href="#insertion">Insertion
sort</a>.
</dd>

<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
At worst O(n<sup>3/2</sup>). It's also possible to use sequences other
than 1, 4, 13, ... but they do not necessarily give the same
efficiency.
</dd>

<dt>Pros</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Usually much faster than regular insertion sort for very little extra work</li>
<li>The fastest of the non-recursive sorts shown here</li>
<li>Easy to get working</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Cons</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Running time is slighly sensitive to the data (but far less so than
binary tree sort or Quicksort)</li>
<li>Not quite as fast as ultra-fast sorts like Quicksort</li>
<li>If you mess up the sequence, you get a sort that will still work
but is slow.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
This is an excellent medium/heavy sort, and after trying this out I decided
to use this whenever I need a large number of items sorted in a hurry and I
don't mind it being a couple of times slower than a heavy duty sort.
</dd>
</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a id="quick">Quicksort</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
Save the value of the middle element of the array. Have a "left" pointer
that starts at the first element and moves right and a "right" pointer that
starts at the last element and moves left. Repeat the following operation
until the pointers cross:

<ul>
<li>Scan with the left pointer until an element larger or equal to the saved 
value is found.</li>
<li>Scan with the right pointer until an element smaller or equal to the
saved value is found.</li>
<li>If the pointers haven't crossed yet, swap the values they point to and
manually advance both pointers one position.</li>
</ul>

Then recursively sort the elements in the ranges [start, right] and [left,
end].
</dd>

<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
<tt>O(n.log n)</tt> on average
</dd>

<dt>Pros</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Extremely fast on average</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Cons</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Fairly tricky to implement and debug</li>
<li>Very slow in the worst case (but see notes)</li>
<li>In the worst case, could cause a stack overflow</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If the middle element in the array is very large or very small, the sort
becomes slower. To reduce the chances of this, you can take median of the
first, middle and last elements and put it in the middle.
</p>

<p>
In a degenerate case, Quick sort could also recurse to a very deep level and
cause a stack overflow. One way to avoid this is to keep track of the level
of recursion (e.g. by passing it as a parameter) and switch to a simpler
sort (like selection sort) if the recursion is too deep.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a id="heap">Heap sort</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
Add the elements to a <a href="../structures/heap.html">heap</a> one at a
time. Then remove the elements from the top of the heap one at a time, and
they will be in order. If the heap is done upside down (i.e. largest element
at the root) then the incomplete sorted list and the heap can share the same
array without requiring extra memory.
</dd>

<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
<tt>O(n.log n)</tt>
</dd>

<dt>Pros</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Guaranteed to be <tt>O(n.log n)</tt></li>
<li>One of the few non-recursive <tt>O(n.log n) sorts</tt></li>
<li>Fairly easy to debug, because it is non-recursive and because it
consists of two smaller and unrelated parts</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Cons</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Not as fast on average as <a href="#quick">Quick sort</a></li>
<li>Quite a lot of code to implement the heap operations</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This isn't an especially useful sort, but the running time is guaranteed
O(n.log n) and it is very light on memory consumption. Also, if you have
already implemented a <a href="../structures/heap.html">heap</a> for
some other reason, then this sort comes almost for free.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to get some extra speed by constructing the heap in one
pass: put everything into the heap ignoring the heap condition, then
work through the heap from bottom to top, bubbling elements down the
heap where necessary. This makes the heap creation take linear time.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a id="merge">Merge sort</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
Split the array in half and recursively sort each half. Then merge the two
halves by keeping a pointer to the front of each list and continuously
taking the smaller of the two elements.
</dd>

<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
<tt>O(n.log n)</tt>
</dd>

<dt>Pros</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Guaranteed to be <tt>O(n.log n)</tt></li>
<li>Simple to understand</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Cons</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Not as fast as <a href="#quick">Quick sort</a> on average</li>
<li>Requires as much memory as the original array</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
<p>
It is convenient to sort the right half backwards, and have the pointer to
the second half move backwards. Then you never have to check whether either
list is empty; the pointer simply moves to the biggest element in the other
and is never used again.
</p>

<p>
I used to like this sort because it is guaranteed <tt>O(n.log n)</tt>, but
it is a memory hog and not as fast as Quicksort in practice.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a id="tree">Binary tree sort</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
Insert each element sequencially into a <a
href="../structures/tree.html#search">binary search tree</a>. The do an
in-order walk of the tree (if you don't know what this is, read the
information on binary search trees).
</dd>

<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
<tt>O(n.log n)</tt> on average
</dd>

<dt>Pros</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If you've already implemented binary search trees, then this sort is
quite easy.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Cons</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Hogs memory for the pointers</li>
<li>Not very pleasant to implement or debug</li>
<li>Not very fast</li>
<li>Is <tt>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</tt> on a sorted list</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
Think of this as the bubble sort of the medium speed sorts: slow and not
very useful. Binary search trees are more useful if you are mixing
things like insertions, searches, and extraction of sorted data.
