<h1>5. Authoring problems</h1>

<p>This page is intended as a resource for people who wish to create olympiad
problems. It's mostly here because members of South African training squad
are required to produce problems for the other members to attempt, so I felt
it would be useful to have some advice.</p>

<p>Before even considering the details of problem statements and test data,
it is necessary to have a problem. This is not as difficult as it might
at first sound, because it is not always necessary to have a brilliant
and original problem. There are lots of existing problems, many of
which are linked to from the <a
href="http://olympiads.win.tue.nl/ioi/">IOI secretariat</a>. While you
cannot copy the problem text or test data without the permission of the
copyright holder, you can re-use an idea and just re-theme it. It is
also not the case that hard problems are better: problems need to be
chosen according to their target contests (or vice versa), and most
contests aim for a range of difficulties. Easy but novel problems are
probably the rarest.</p>

<p>Assuming you have an original idea, or are adapting an idea from
another problem, your next step is to think up solutions. Don't stop as
soon as youe found a fast but complicated solution; there may be
equally fast but simpler solutions. You should also consider what
slower solutions people may use, since you may need to separate them
from the faster ones, or in some cases you may decide that the faster
solutions are too difficult and decide to give full credit to a slower
solution. It is generally impractical to try to
distinguish O(N) from O(N.log N) or sometimes even O(N<sup>2</sup>),
because the I/O will tend to dominate the running time, and will vary
enormously between languages (also keep in mind that, for example, a
permutation of the numbers from 1 to N takes O(N.log N) digits in the
input file). Often it is possible to tweak the problem slightly, for
example by adding an extra loop around the outside, so that the
relative impact of I/O shrinks. This will also reduce the size of input
files, which makes them more practical to store and distribute and
reduces that noise that could be introduced by disk caches and so on.</p>

<p>Once you have a good idea for a problem and know what reward you
want to give to various solutions, you are ready to begin writing the
problem statement.</p>
