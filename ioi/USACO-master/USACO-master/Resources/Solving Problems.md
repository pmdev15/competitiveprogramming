# Solving Problems

[Errichto - How to practice](https://github.com/Errichto/youtube/wiki/How-to-practice%3F)

> What problems have I done over the last month? (August 2018)

Mostly CEOI, JOI, Baltic OI, APIO problems from oj.uz (see OI Checklist). Also some CSAcademy, and 30+ hours of live competition. I have finished an average of ~4/5 problems from all div 1 rounds from CF round 400 on.

Usually I just ignore the problems which are solved by a negligible amount of people and work in decreasing order of solves. :)

> How to solve problems?

(Not sure how helpful this is, let me know if you have a better method.)

First, scan the problem. Note the limits on the variables and the time limit.

Case 1: You (think) know how to do it.

For example, division 2 A-D usually just test common sense. Doing a lot of division 2 and educational rounds during school helps. Other times, it can be a Div 1 H which you can recognize as suffix array + RMQ + persistent segment tree. In this case, make sure that you have a good library of data structures.

Case 2: You don’t have any immediate ideas.

First, switch problems until case 1 occurs, if possible. Otherwise, let’s assume that you are stuck. If you have multiple unsolved problems, preferably do the easier ones first. However, do not spend all your time on one problem, as I did for E during the last combined CodeForces round when F could be solved much more quickly. (For reference, the former took me 49 minutes, while the latter took me 8 minutes.) Of course, the same goes for math contests. :o

Note: If someone in your friends list of comparable level did the problem quickly, either they’ve seen it before or it’s not that hard (I like to believe that this is true even when it isn’t :|).

For IOI, the problems don't require any advanced data structures, so your options are more limited (as in, if you don’t know the topic, keep iterating through the syllabus until you get it). Most of the time, the subtasks are quite helpful for solving hard problems (although I'm not sure whether this is true for IOI 2018 Meetings).

> how many problems you do per day

I don't know, look at my CF profile and try to estimate.

> do you think if i know an answer i still should code it to improve coding speed ?

Probably.

> how long do u try a problem before u give up [on CodeForces]

Sometimes I glance at the editorial before looking at the problem. This lets me get an idea of how complex the solution is and how long it's going to take. It doesn't necessarily spoil the problem, since some editorials are not very well-written and it still takes quite a bit of effort to understand. :)

I don’t want to be in a position where I have nothing left to try, so I might as well get the general idea. Leave being stuck for the real contests. :P

> what about others

If it’s from an Olympiad then I'll try to solve it for a while (or try to forget about it if I can't). If I don't solve it I'll come back the next day and think of something new (or look up the solution ...)
