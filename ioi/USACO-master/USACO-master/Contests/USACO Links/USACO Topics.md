   * 9.1: Silver
   * 9.2 (binary indexed tree): Gold

   * Note:
      * I would generally say that problems involving lowest common ancestor (LCA) or heavy-light decomposition (HLD) belong in platinum despite the notable exception of [cowland](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=921) (which was probably more suitable for platinum).
