### Option 2 (Old)

Follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/HUGG/GNU+compiler+install+on+Mac+OS+X?fbclid=IwAR3bnM6A_kTgXD2p5nOfVbxRRQ4nHMj89jllNy1-zdtfXfcq1czbSoXiWgE). Step 4 will give errors but it should still install.

### OS X Mojave

Navigate to your bash profile
```
gedit ~/.bash_profile
```
and add the following line:
```
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/include/c++/8.1.0/:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
```

### OS X Catalina

Maybe the following links are helpful?

~~Whoops I couldn't figure out how to use g++ successfully D:~~ Turns out that g++ was linked to g++-8 instead of g++-9, changing it now works.
