<h1>2.2. Recursion</h1>

<p>
Recursion is when a procedure or function calls itself. It is extremely
difficult to grasp at first, but a very powerful concept. Here's a trivial
example:
</p>

<pre>
function sum_to_n(n : integer) : integer;
begin
     if n = 1 then sum_to_n := 1
     else sum_to_n := n + sum_to_n(n - 1);
end;
</pre>

<p>
This calculates the sum of the numbers up to <tt>n</tt>. It works by first
finding out the sum of the numbers up to <tt>n - 1</tt> and then adding
<tt>n</tt>. This sounds a bit like circular reasoning, and if it wasn't for 
the first line of the function it would be. The first line prevents the
function for endlessly calling itself by explicitly returning the sum of the
numbers up to 1, namely 1.
</p>

<p>
This is the simplest form of recursion, and it would be really easy to
replace the whole thing with a loop that goes from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>n</tt>
and increments a counter. Here's a more complex example that would be
slightly harder to replace with iteration (although <em>any</em> recursion
can be replaced by iteration):
</p>

<pre>
function power(a, b : longint) : longint;
begin
     if b = 0 then power := 1
     else if odd(b) then power := a * power(a, b - 1)
     else power := sqr(power(a, b div 2));
end;
</pre>

<p>
This calculates <tt>a<sup>b</sup></tt> with <a
href="efficiency.html#bigo">order</a> <tt>O(log b)</tt>. It relies on the
facts that <tt>a<sup>b+1</sup> = a.a<sup>b</sup></tt> and <tt>a<sup>2b</sup>
= (a<sup>b</sup>)<sup>2</sup></tt>.
</p>

<h2><a id="pros">Pros of recursion</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>Recursive procedures are usually much shorter, simpler and easier to debug
than iterative versions.</li>
<li>Many algorithms are defined recursively, so it is easy to implement them
recursively.</li>
<li>Many data structures are naturally recursive
(<a href="../structures/tree.html">trees</a>, for example) and so it
is natural to operate on them recursively.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><a id="cons">Cons of recursion</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>Recursive procedures are slightly slower than iterative ones, because of
the overhead of procedure calls.</li>
<li>Recursive procedures can use a lot of stack space.</li>
<li>Badly thought out recursive procedures can sometimes be <em>very</em>
slow. For example, you might be tempted to use the following to calculate
any given term of the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 etc, where
each term is the sum of the previous two):

<pre>
function fibonacci(n : integer) : integer;
begin
     if n &lt; 3 then fibonacci := 1
     else fibonacci := fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1);
end;
</pre>

The problem with this is that <tt>fibonacci(n - 1)</tt> also calls
<tt>fibonacci(n - 2)</tt>, so the latter is calculated twice. For smaller
<tt>n</tt>, the calculation is done even more times. The net result is
that the running time is exponential. A far better way to do
this would be as follows:

<pre>
function fibonacci(n : integer) : integer;
var
   prev, cur, temp : integer;
   i : integer;
begin
     prev := 0;
     cur := 1;
     for i := 2 to n do
      begin
       temp := prev + cur;
       prev := cur;
       cur := temp;
      end;
     fibonacci := cur;
</pre>

It's longer than the recursive version, but much, much, faster.
</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><a id="caching">Caching</a></h2>


<p>
Sometimes it isn't so trivial to convert a recursive algorithm into an
iterative one, but you still know that the same work is being done
repeatedly and want to eliminate this. A quick way (although not
necessarily the best; dynamic programming is usually better) to do this
is to save the result the first time it is calculated, and then use the
saved version later. This relies on there being enough memory to save
all possible results that one might want to store.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example, applied to the Fibonacci problem.
</p>
<pre>
var
   cache : array[1..MAXN] of longint;

procedure initialise;
begin
     fill cache with -1's, indicating that the value isn't known
     fillchar(cache, sizeof(cache), 255); 
     if we initialise the first 2 here, it simplies the real function
     cache[1] := 1;
     cache[2] := 1;
end;

function fibonacci(n : integer) : longint;
begin
     if (cache[n] = -1) then
       cache[n] := fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
     fibonacci := cache[n];
end;
</pre>
