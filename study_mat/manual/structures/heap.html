<h1>1.6. Heaps</h1>

<p>
A heap is a a type of <a href="tree.html">tree</a>. It is mostly useful as
an implementation of a <a href="priority.html">priority queue</a>, and it is
also the data structures used in <a href="../algorithms/sorting.html#heap">heapsort</a>.
</p>

<p>
A heap is a binary tree with the properties that it is perfectly balanced
and that any node is larger than both its children (or smaller than both
its children - you can choose which definition to use based on the problem
at hand). The operations that can be performed on a heap are insertion of an
item into the heap and removal of the root of the heap.
</p>

<p>
Although a heap is a tree, it is well suited to an array representation: The
root is element 1, and the children of node <tt>i</tt> are <tt>2i</tt> and
<tt>2i+1</tt>. For example:
</p>

<div><img src="../images/heap.png" alt="A binary heap" /></div>

<hr />
<h2><a id="insertion">Insertion</a></h2>


<ol>
<li>Add the new element to the next available slot / next array index.</li>
<li>While the element is greater than its parent, swap it with the parent.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h2><a id="deletion">Deleting the root</a></h2>


<ol>
<li>Replace the root with the last element.</li>
<li>While this element is smaller than either of its children, swap it with
the larger child (if there are two children).</li>
</ol>
