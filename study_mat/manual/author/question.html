<h1>5.1. The problem statement</h1>

<hr />
<h2><a id="format">The format</a></h2>


<p>
In general IOI-style problems have most of the following sections:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction that explains the requirements of the problem, without
going into details like input format or constraints. Clarifications of
ambiguous cases can go either in here or separately.</li>
<li>Specifications of the input and output formats and filenames, including
examples. It is a good idea to make the examples correspond, since that can
aid understanding of the problem. However make sure that the formats are
fully defined even without the examples. If either format includes lines with
characters, make sure that you specify whether they are separated by spaces.
If numbers can be floating point, make this clear (the IOI rules don't permit
floating point formats, and they are usually bad news).</li>
<li>Constraints on the input data, and optionally on the output data (e.g.
<q>all output values can be represented by 32-bit signed integers</q>). There must
be constraints (possibly implicit ones) on all the parameters, otherwise
the programmer cannot choose data structures (even for numbers: what if they
contain a million digits?) and algorithms properly. In some contests
this is folded into other sections, but must still be present. In the
SACO this is always an explicit section.</li>
<li>Resource limits, such as CPU time and memory. In the SACO only the
time limit is specified here; other contests vary, depending on whether
constraints are set uniformly or per-problem.</li>
<li>Scoring, if it is anything other than a simple all-or-nothing. For
the SACO, there is always a section for scoring, and the scoring
algorithm should be specified (rather than <q>partial marks for
partially correct answers</q>).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is standard practice to <em>theme</em> problems in some way. For
example, the USACO always sets problems about Farmer John and his cows,
while recent SACOs have used a Monty Python theme. This serves to make
the problem more interesting, but more importantly it allows the
problem to be explained without the use of technical terms.</p>

<h2><a id="general">General advice</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>Many problems are designed to model real life situations. There are many
assumptions that can be made in real life, but you should explicitly state
these in the problem to avoid ambiguity. It is also a good idea to list cases
where a real life assumption cannot be made for your problem. On the
other hand, you should avoid repetition, because it can lead to
problems if the problem is later changed and only one copy is altered.</li>
<li>Try to consider borderline cases. For example, if x lies <q>between
A and B</q>,
may it equal A or B? Does <q>within x seconds</q> mean that x seconds exactly is
included or excluded?</li>
<li>Also try to consider cases that affect the difficulty of the problem.
For example, may a particular list of things contain duplicates? It could be
that you didn't intend people to have to eliminate duplicates but they will
have to anyway because they don't know that they're not expected to do so. Don't
make people do more work than you intended when you thought up the
problem.</li>
<li>You should write a sample solution to your problem. Apart from the obvious
reasons, it will often force you to think about ambiguities that you didn't
consider when composing the problem.</li>
<li>Avoid technical terms such as <q>network flow</q>. You should be able to
explain the problem to someone who knows nothing of computer
science.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><a id="graphs">Graphs</a></h2>


<p>
<a href="../algorithms/graphs.html">Graph theory</a> problems have a whole set
of common pitfalls for the problem designer. Always consider the items on
this checklist and if appropriate, add information to your problem statement.
</p>
<ul>
<li>May a vertex have an edge to itself?</li>
<li>Are the edges directed? For example, is a road from A to B a one-way or
two-way road?</li>
<li>May there be more than one edge between two vertices? If the edges are
directed, may these be in the same direction or only in opposite directions?</li>
<li>Are edges duplicated in the input file? (this ought to be implicitly clear
from the input format, but this is not always the case)</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are also some variations on what a "path" may be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>May it visit a vertex more than once?</li>
<li>May it use an edge more than once?</li>
<li>May it be a cycle?</li>
<li>May it backtrack (i.e. A->B->A)?</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><a id="geometry">Geometry</a></h2>


<p>Just as with graph theory, geometry has a host of special cases that
sometimes need to be considered and clarified:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the endpoints of a line considered to be on the line?</li>
<li>Are the edges of a polygon considered to be inside or outside?</li>
<li>Do lines intersect if the endpoint of one is on the other? And if they
only share a vertex? What if they coincide?</li>
<li>Are any structures degenerate? i.e. lines with 0 length, polygons with
0 area etc.</li>
<li>May polygons contain redundant vertices i.e. an internal angle of 180
degrees?</li>
<li>May polygons be non-convex?</li>
<li>May polygons be self-intersecting? What about just self-meeting?</li>
<li>Are two polygons that touch on an edge said to intersect? What if they
just share one point?</li>
<li>In input and output files, are the vertices of a polygon listed in sequence
or in arbitrary order?</li>
<li>Are the given points unique?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Another issue with geometry is that the distance between two points is seldom
an integer. This can present problems because the rounding error in floating
point arithmetic may cause a perfectly valid algorithm to produce incorrect
answers. Try to avoid using distances, especially comparing distances (for
example, finding the shortest path). An alternative is to define a different
distance function, such as the Manhattan distance (delta x plus delta y) which
will always be an integer.
