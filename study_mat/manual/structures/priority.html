<h1>1.9. Priority queues</h1>

<p>
A priority queue is similar to a <a href="queue.html">queue</a>. The
difference is that every item has an associated priority, and instead of
removing the item that has been in the queue the longest, you remove the
item with the highest priority. This is like a print queue, where higher
priority jobs are printed first. Another use of a priority queue is
simulations, where the priority of an event is the time that it will take
place. Thus events can be scheduled in any order, and then simulated in
chronological order.

<p>
For priority queues that could get very large, a <a href="heap.html">heap</a> 
is by far the best option. However, for small priority queues (say less that
50 elements) a simpler solution like a sorted array or a sorted <a
href="linkedlist.html">linked list</a> will probably run faster.
