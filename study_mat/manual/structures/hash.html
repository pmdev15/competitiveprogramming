<h1>1.3. Hash tables</h1>

<p>
A hash table is a data structure useful for storing a set of items in which
the order is not important. It is useful if you want to be able to build a
set up an element at a time, and at every stage being able to know whether a
particular element is in the table (e.g. for avoiding duplicates).
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="implementation">How does it work?</a></h2>


<p>
The basis of a hash table is a <em>hash function</em>. A hash function is a
function that takes an element of whatever data type you are storing
(integer, string, etc) and outputs an integer in a certain range.
</p>

<p>A good
hash function is one that gets a fairly even distribution of the numbers in
the output range, even if the input values are very poorly distributed (for
example, English words are poorly distributed since they only use 26 different
letters and some letters and some combinations of letter occur far more
frequently than others.
</p>

<p>
Many hash functions work by computing a large value modulo the table
size. In this case it is generally a good idea to make the table size a
prime number.
</p>

<p>
The hash table itself consists of an array whose indexes are the range of
the hash function. You should always try to make the table at least 50%
bigger than the actual number of items that will ever need to be stored in
it, and the larger the better. The elements of the array are just elements
of the set you are using (you can also store associated values with each
key). You also need a way to specify whether any given
array entry is "in use" or not. Elements can occur anywhere in the hash
table, with the condition that there must be no unused entries between an
element's hash value and the element's address.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="insertion">Insertion</a></h2>

<p>
To add an element to the hash table, first apply the hash function to it to
get a <em>hash value</em>. Then go to that element in the array, and search
from there until you find a table entry that isn't occupied (possibly
wrapping at the end of the array). Then place the element in the empty table
entry.
</p>
