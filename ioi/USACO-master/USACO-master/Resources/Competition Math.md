## FAQ

> Will this advice get me from x to y within z time?

No guarantees.

> What if I can't do a problem?

If you're still coming up with new ideas, keep thinking. Otherwise, you have several options:
 * Look at [part of] the solution. (If CodeForces, look at the tags.)
 * Leave it for a while and do something else if you actually want to solve it on your own.
 * Get a hint from someone else.

I'm impatient, so usually I go with the first option. Sometimes I end up reading a CF editorial before reading the statement? Idk if this is a good strategy tho. :/

> I think something should be added or clarified.
