# Questions & Comments

You might want to read [Um_nik's FAQ](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/47516) too. I hope this is slightly more informative. :)

## General

> Hey, could you help me get started with competitive programming.

> Please suggest me some steps how I can get better in competitive programming.

> Please suggest me a step by step process so that I can master DS and ALGO on my own and be great at coding.

> all i want from you sir show me the way to do competitive programming i'm not good in mathematics but i really wanna work hard in algortihms/ds i haven't anybody else that interested in CP so i just wanna take guide from you sir please :) show me the way only and i'll surely do that and yes there are tons of blogs about CP how to get start and blah blah but i wanna learn from you people so sir i'm expecting my answer from you if you won't reply i'll lose my motivation please sir :) reply me and may god bless you thanks soo much. please just show me the way like what to do first (1) step (2) step (3) step please guide me like that i'm not saying just teach me i'm saying show me the way and i'll find resources and surely i'll do thanks soo much sir please reply me

> hey can u tell how to practice for cp ?

> I have just started on codeforces and competetive programming. Can you suggest something?

I hope this link helps you. If not, please let me know!

> does this contains all the things or full training materials

I tried to add everything I could think of.

> Where did you learn programming :D ?

> which platform do you have use mostly ?

> What's the online judge that you used to practice your programming skills?

CodeForces, as I'm usually able to do the contests which occur on weekends.

> Did you learn algorithms and then practiced them accordingly or you randomly started solving questions and then looked up at the algorithms which you didn't know or some other way(like following a book, etc.)?

Mostly just looking stuff up along the way.

> Can you describe in one sentence how to be good at competitive programming?

> What are the ways that you practice makes you so perfect about programming?

Keep doing interesting problems (and stay organized??) idk

> I find difficult to prepare for math and cp competitions together without neglecting school ...  I know you obviously can't solve my problem, but I'd just like to have the advice of an expert like you and if you've ever been in my situation

You shouldn't neglect school, but generally I've kept up with schoolwork and still had plenty of free time.

> do you have a particular method to organize time well and manage everything (competitions, courses, homework ...)

> Pls which calendar do u use to structure ur coding schedule.

clist.by & workflowy & google calendar

> Which site to practice on ? I want to concentrate only on one ... Which is better way of practice, doing questions topic wise ? Or sorting all the questions in ascending order and try to complete as many as possible ?

I don’t know, try all of them and see what works for you ...

> What was your strategy considering you were preparing for IOI.

Other than doing past IOI tasks, I didn't do anything specifically for IOI. If you're looking for olympiad problems see "Contests."

## Redirection

> bro could u please tell me only one more thing where u learned matheatics ?

> After how much time thinking on a problem should I look at the editorial?

> How to practice problems when I don't understand tutorial. It really bothers me. Do you have any suggestions?

See "Competition Math."

> which problems should I solve

See "Contests."

> Can you provide me some coding books where I can inprove my skills.

See "Resources."

> I looked at your guide, but some resources were quite difficult.

See "Resources" again; I think that CPH and USACO Bronze are definitely okay for beginners.

> i think whenever i am learning some new topic i m not able to solve good questions on that topic so thats what holding me back.

I hope the links in "Implementations" will suffice.

> Can you suggest me some of the topics or algorithms I need to master to rock on Silver Category???

See "Contests" -> "USACO Links."

## Topics

> I have covered the basic concepts of topics like Number Theory, Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, but I am unable to do contest questions C and D, will you please help me

> I am facing problems at DP problems. I am currently thinking that first I learn all DS like(fft, persistance etc) and after that start practicing. or sholud I start practice and learn DS whenever it required ? I fill that to solve DIV-1 C,D problems advanced DS is must am I right ?

Well, a fair amount of C and D questions are hard precisely because they don't really fall into any of these categories.

> i m always interested in this but i m not able to understand whether i m doin wrong by taking hard topics and not able to solve questions on them  or am i doing wrong on solving too easy ones ,

Idk, there are plenty of hard questions involving easy topics.

> what is your view on mathematics for CP? Is it highly required for one to be really good at discrete math to advance to the next level?

It's required in the sense that you need to know it to solve a lot of problems, but this applies to other topics as well ...

> The topics, such generally does not appear on USACO contest, are topics such appear on IOI competitions or generally does not appear on IOI too?

Many topics that are banned by the IOI are used in USACO contests (look up the IOI syllabus).

> In what order or from where would you suggest to solve dp problems ? I have read and understand standard dp problems but i am not very much good in thinking dp solutions.

I don't think the order really matters (aside from doing easier problems first?!)

> Can you compare CPH and "Competitive Programming 3" of Steven and Felix Halim?

The former is quite good. I haven't read the latter.

> I am stuck on a CSES task, know as "Hotels", I saw your name in the top 5 fastest solutions. Can you give me some hint on how to solve it, just a little will be okay too.

> i need help with a problem related to calculating ( a power b )mod prime

> i need help with  a combinatorial problem. the problem is as follows : given a grid of size 2xN, you need to count number of ways to paint the blocks of this grid with M litres of red colour such that painted blocks does not share a side. To paint 1 block ,1 litre of colour is required. I can do this with the help of dynamic programming if value of N less than 1000. Can I solve this problem in case of N <= 10^9. (codechef)

> hi dude, can you help me please?, I realy stuck at this problem, could you give me a hint?, I think it is a graph problem

If you give me a link to the problem and I find it sufficiently interesting, then I might solve it (or not, if I don't check my messages).

> Any opinion on working through random contests v.s. practicing topic by topic?

Not really (but I would definitely recommend going through the CPH problemset).

## Personal?

> When did you start

> What is your competitive programming story?

Started the summer after 8th grade, see this [old post.](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/49514?#comment-335196)

> I want to know if you followed a certain training routine to make such a progress.

I don't really have a specific training routine? Sometimes I make spreadsheets to serve as checklists though.

> I really like the way you put reminder below your code, it's really useful.

Unfortunately, I usually submit without reading it.

> What do you think about virtual contests?

Until recently, I don’t believe that I have ever finished a virtual contest while strictly adhering to the time limit. It’s not as fun as a real contest. :(

> could you please tell me which IDE do you use on your MAC?

I use https://ideone.com/ LOL. I used to use https://csacademy.com/ but it looks like the queue times are rlly bad now. Locally I use Sublime Text w/ command line. At IOI I used Geany.

[Why the downvotes? :(](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/63065?#comment-469907)

> Do you use a debugger?

No, ~~I can't figure out how to get GDB to work on Mac~~ and print statements generally suffice. Actually, [these instructions](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin) work but sometimes it hangs ...

> did you do it on your own or did you have a coach !

> Did you study in USACO camps or by yourself

> Are you like entirely self taught, or did you have any tutoring.

mostly self? haven't been tutored or done any tutoring myself

## Bad


> I've been doing Programming since almost 2 years, And I didn't see a much progress. I sometimes struggle with Div2 C in contest time. I have solved almost 400 problems from different OJs like spoj, codechef or cf. I generally got fear from higher difficulty problems.

> i left coding some months ago. i was distressed as i was not doing well as i was not improving , the time when i started codechef contests  i was stuck on question 4 or 5 and now also i m stuck on same level questions

Do more problems? :shrug:

> https://www.codechef.com/JULY18A/problems/GEARS This is the problem, I am trying to solve.

> hey friend, please please send me the code for C small only. please i beg you.i need job badly .please. only c small.please please Please friend. i am not getting job Save my life only c small .Please. i beg you

don't ask me to solve tasks from active contests ...

> can i become red coder in just a year ? if i work hard like 6-7 hours in a day ?

> what you think i mean what helped you most to become red

> I'm just curious if there anything in particular that you would say helped you improve from purple to red?

> How you become Red in CF in 2 year !

> How to solve any problem?

idk

> How much time it takes almost ? [to become red]

2 year !

> Will it be a good idea to follow your profile on any of this site and do all the questions you have done ?

Doubt it. (How are you going to do ALL of the questions that I've done? o_O)

> How much time you spend almost daily ?

> How many hours you practice daily?

Idk, you can probably estimate from my submission history and tell me.

> ur graph seems very interesting to me .

ok !

> but i don't know where to start

idk either (just go with CPH?)

> please please could u please tell me how much mathematics or TOPICS needed for CP ? please tell me please

a lot

> how can I solve problem B(div 2) and C(div 2) regular  in codeforces contest

think (and practice)

> Do I need to be really smart to be good at CP.

yes

> If I walk with your link on github only enough to be a master on CodeForces in 3 month's  , and Pass an interview in international companies like : amazon , facebook , apple , google...etc

no

> it will be very helpfull if u write a blog for trick open close interval dp .there are some questions having 3 dimension using concepts of open close interval . i m not albe to get them

what even is that lol

> why don't u defeat umnik and tourist

I'm not as good ... (yet)

> hi

??
