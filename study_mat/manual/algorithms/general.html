<h2><a id="memory">Memory use</a></h2>


<p>
Remember that a competition is different from real world programming.
In the real world you should try to conserve memory. In competitions you
usually have a set memory limit, and you get the same number of points
irrespective of how much you use. For example, if you are using a
<a href="../structures/hash.html">hash table</a> then you can make the
hash table much bigger than you really need. You should also not be
afraid to use larger types (32-bit vs. 16-bit integers, for example) than
necessary, as overflows caused by using undersized data types aren't
always easy to detect.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="pass">Multiple passes</a></h2>

<p>
In spite of what was said above, sometimes there is a shortage of memory.
In some cases it is possible to work around this by making several passes
through the input file. To illustrate this, consider the following
problem: A number of coloured rectangles are placed on top of each
other, with vertices at integer coordinates and aligned with the axes.
You must find the area of each colour that is visible.
</p>

<p>
Although there are better ways to solve this problem, a simple
approach is to create a 2D array in memory to simulate the area in
which the rectangles are being placed, and for each rectangle, draw it
in on the array. The problem is that the constraints of the problem may
make the canvas too large to fit into memory. If it is only slightly
too large then the problem can be solved by splitting the canvas into
a few smaller pieces, and making a separate pass through the input file
for each piece of the canvas. For each piece one can store the area of
each colour and then total this across all the pieces to get an answer.
