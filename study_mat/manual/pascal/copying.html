<h1>3.2. Copying data</h1>

<hr />
<h2><a id="fillchar">Fillchar</a></h2>


<p>
<code>fillchar</code> is a Pascal function that allows you to fill any
data structure with a particular byte. Although it would appear to only be
useful for arrays of bytes, a little knowledge of the storage format of
other structures can make it a lot more useful.
</p>

<p>
Many data types can be zeroed by using <code>fillchar</code> with an
argument of 0. This includes all integer and floating point types as well as
the <code>set</code> type (makes it the empty set), and will set boolean
variables to false. A value of 255 (0xff) will set signed integer data types
to -1, and unsigned integer data types to their largest possible value. A
value of 127 (0x7f) will set signed integer data types to a value close to
their largest value.
</p>

<p>
In many cases, these operations could be done with a <code>for</code>
loop. The reasons for using <code>fillchar</code> are that it is quicker to
write and it is quite optimised.
</p>

<h2><a id="move">Move</a></h2>


<p>
A similar function to <code>fillchar</code> is <code>move</code>. This
allows a chunk of data to be copied from one memory location to another. It
is more flexible than the assignment operator because you don't have to copy
complete data structures; you can select any region of memory you like. This
makes it quite handy when using <a href="dynamic.html">dynamic arrays</a>.
