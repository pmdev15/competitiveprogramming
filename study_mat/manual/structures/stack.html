<h1>1.7. Stacks</h1>

<hr />
<h2><a id="what">What is a stack?</a></h2>


<p>
A stack is a data structure that works like a stack of items, such as
plates. Items can be placed onto the stack, and the most recently added item
can be removed at any point. This principle is sometimes referred to as
<em>LIFO</em> (which stands for <em>Last In First Out</em>) because the
last item onto the stack is the first one off it.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="use">What's it for?</a></h2>


<p>
Stacks have a number of uses. One of them is recursion: although the
compiler usually hides the details for you, the arguments to procedures as
well as the return addresses are placed on a stack and removed when the
procedure exits. You might need a stack if you are simulating recursion.
</p>

<p>
Another use is to evaluate expressions in postfix or Reverse Polish notation
(used by old HP calculators). Basically place numbers on the stack as they
are encountered, and whenever an operator is found, pop the top two numbers
off the stack, apply the operator to them and push the result back on the
stack.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>


<p>
Stacks are easier to implement that <a href="queue.html">queues</a> because
you only ever work at one end. The simplest method is to keep an array that
contains the items (with the bottom stack element at the start of the array)
and a count of how many items there are. To push an item onto the stack,
increase the count and write it into the array. To pop an item off the
stack, copy the data from the array and decrease the count.
</p>

<p>
The only disadvantages of this approach are the limits imposed by arrays in
some environments such as the 64K limit on data structures in real mode
environments (e.g. Turbo Pascal) and the inability to easily resize an array
(although you can get around this in Pascal with <a
href="../pascal/dynamic.html">dynamic allocation</a>). It is possible to
implement a stack using a <a href="linkedlist.html">linked list</a>, but it
is a lot more complicated.
