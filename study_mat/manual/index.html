<h1>Computer Olympiad Training Manual</h1>

<p>
This is a manual of things that will help you in computer olympiads like the
final round of the South African Computer Olympiad (SACO) and the
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). A lot of the information here
is more general and will be generally useful, while other information is
geared specifically towards competitions is not useful in general.
</p>

<p>
A lot of the information here is based on my own experience rather than
formal training, and as such it is rather haphazard and some of the
ideas and terminology might be rather unorthodox. It is not intended as a
replacement for a good book on algorithms (I recommend <i>Algorithms</i> or
<i>Algorithms in C</i> by Sedgewick). It is intended to look at the
theory from the perspective of olympiad programming and to give some extra
tricks that are useful for olympiad programming.
</p>

<p><strong>This manual is also very very dated.</strong> With the benefit of
experience, there are some things I would do differently. I certainly wouldn't
recommend using Pascal for olympiads when so many of the algorithms and data
structures described here are provided by other languages (C++, Java, Python
etc). I've left it online anyway in case anyone finds it useful, but don't
take it as gospel.

<p>
These pages are designed to be read through in order. Just click the [Next]
link at the bottom of each page (you can also <a
href="manual.zip">download</a> all the pages). You will notice that these
pages are not pretty with lots of funky pictures; they are designed to be
functional and I don't feel any urge to decorate them.

<p>
There are a number of other sites you may find useful for training.
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://olympiad.cs.uct.ac.za">Past problems of the South
African Computer Olympiad</a>, back to 1998, as well as training camp
problems.</li>
<li><a href="http://ace.delos.com/usacogate">USACO Gateway</a>: an enormous
collection of problems and some theory, put together by the USA Computer
Olympiad guys. It has real-time grading of your solutions, too. I
highly recommend this if you want to practice olympiad programming.</li>
<li><a href="http://olympiads.win.tue.nl/ioi">IOI Secretariat</a>: past IOI
problems, plus links to many national and regional olympiads.</li>
