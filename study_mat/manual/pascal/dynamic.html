<h1>3.3. Dynamic allocation</h1>

<hr />
<h2><a id="problem">The problem</a></h2>


<p>
The <code>new</code> command in Pascal does not allow you to choose
how much memory to allocate at run time; thus when creating an array you
must choose an upper bound in advance. This presents problems when for
example you need 200 lists with a maximum total size of 60000 bytes. Since
each array could be up to 60000 bytes by itself, you would need to allocate
60000 bytes to each array. This is clearly not practical. The usual solution
in this case is to use linked lists. However, linked lists are not well
suited to all applications, have a high memory overhead and are usually slow
to work with. They are also more difficult to write and debug.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="solution">The solution</a></h2>


<p>
The solution is <em>dynamic allocation</em>, which means to allocate to each
array only as much memory as it needs at run time. This will be old news to
C programmers who are basically forced to do this using the
<code>malloc</code> command. In Pascal you need to use the
<code>getmem</code> and <code>freemem</code> commands.
</p>

<h2><a id="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>


<pre>
type
    integer_array = array[1..30000] of integer;
    integer_pointer = ^integer_array;
var
   the_pointer : integer_pointer;    {pointer to access the array}
   number : integer;                 {actual number of items}
begin
     {get the actual number of items}
     getmem(the_pointer, number * sizeof(integer));
     {do stuff with the the_pointer^ array}
     freemem(the_pointer, number * sizeof(integer));
end.
</pre>

<p>
This code illustrates how to dynamically allocate memory for the array. Note
that although the upper limit of 30000 is arbitrary: the actual limit is
<code>number</code>, and it is up to you to make sure that you never use a
higher index (otherwise some really weird stuff can happen). You should make
the arbitrary limit as high as possible to prevent range check errors that
will result if the error checker thinks you are trying to access something
that is out of bounds (the range checker doesn't know about dynamic allocation).
You must also make sure that the <code>freemem</code> command specifies the
same amount of memory as the <code>getmem</code> command.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="resizing">Resizing</a></h2>


<p>
It is not possible to directly resize a dynamically allocated array. You
must allocate a new array, <a href="copying.html#move">copy</a> the data into
the new array and free the old array.
</p>

<p>
Because of this, it may sometimes be necessary to make an initial pass of
the input file to determine how much memory to allocate to each array before
doing the main pass to fill the arrays with data.
