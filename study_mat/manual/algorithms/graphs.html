<h1>2.6. Graphs</h1>

<p>
In this context, the word "graph" does not refer to a plot of one variable
against another, but a more abstract concept: A set of nodes, some of which
are joined together by edges. An examples is a set of cities (the nodes)
connected by various flights (the edges). There are many problems that can
be translated into graphs. These often involve a journey between the nodes
using the edges.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="terminology">Terminology</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>The things that are connected are called <em>vertices</em> or <em>nodes</em>.
Mathematicians call them vertices but computer scientists sometimes call them nodes
because they can model nodes in a network.</li>
<li>The things connecting them are called <em>edges</em>.</li>
<li>A <em>path</em> is a list of edges, with each adjacent pair sharing a vertex.</li>
<li>A <em>cycle</em> is similar to a path, but the first and last edges also share a vertex.</li>
<li>A graph is <em>connected</em> if there exists a path between any two points.</li>
<li>A <em>subgraph</em> is a subset of the vertices of the graph and all the
edges between any two of them.</li>
<li>A subgraph is considered to be a <em>component</em> of the original graph
if it is connected and there are no edges between a vertex in the subgraph
and a vertex not in the subgraph.</li>
<li>A <em>tree</em> is a connected graph with no cycles.</li>
<li>A <em>forest</em> is any graph with no cycles.</li>
<li>An <em>Eulerian path</em> is a path that uses every edge exactly once.</li>
<li>A <em>Hamiltonian path</em> is a path that uses every vertex exactly once.</li>
<li>Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles are defined similarly.</li>
<li>A <em>complete</em>graph is one in which every vertex is connected to
every other vertex once.</li>
<li>A vertex is a <em>neighbour</em> of another if there is an edge between
them.</li>
<li>A <em>dense</em> graph is one where most of the potential edges are
actual edges. The opposite of a dense graph is a <em>sparse</em> graph. These
are relative terms, like "big" and "small".</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><a id="variations">Variations</a></h2>


<p>
There are numerous oddities that can occur in graphs that can occur in some
problems but not in others, and it is worth remembering these when designing
an algorithm.
</p>

<ul>
<li>A point might be connected to itself.</li>
<li>Two points might be have more than one edge between them.</li>
<li>Edges are sometimes <em>directed</em>. This means that you can only travel
along the edge in one direction.</li>
<li>Edges are sometimes <em>weighted</em>. Each edge has a certain real
number associated with it, and the weight of a path is the sum of the
weights on the edges. The weight is also called the length or cost.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><a id="representation">Representation</a></h2>


<p>
There are a number of ways to represent graphs in memory. You can have a
matrix where you store a boolean value for every pair of vertices specifying
whether an edge exists between those two points. You can store a list of
neighbours for every vertex; or you can just store a list of edges (there
are probably be other ways, but I can't think of any really useful ones
offhand).
</p>

<p>
Graphs are a good example of places where redundant data structures can save
time. For example, if you want to execute an operation for every edge then a
list of edges will be useful. If you want to construct paths then a list of
neighbours for every point will be useful, because you know which points you
can go to next. For determining whether there is an edge between two points,
the matrix representation would be the most useful.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="spanning">Minimum spanning tree</a></h2>


<p>
A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph that is a tree and which has
edges to every vertex (so no vertices are "isolated"). The minimum spanning
tree of a weighted graph is the spanning tree for which the sum of the
weights of the edges in the tree is the minimum (this isn't necessarily
unique). There are three standard algorithms for finding the MST:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a subgraph with no edges. Repeatedly add the shortest edge
that doesn't create a cycle, until the graph is a spanning tree.</li>
<li>Start with a subgraph that is the same as the original graph. Delete the
longest edge that will still keep the subgraph connected. Repeat until the
graph is a spanning tree.</li>
<li>Start by making the tree consist only of one of the vertices (an arbitrary
one). Repeatedly add the shortest edge between a vertex in the tree
and a vertex not in the tree, to the tree.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The graph will be a spanning tree when the number of edges is one less that
the number of vertices.
</p>

<p>The last method can be implemented as a slight variation on
<a href="#shortest">Dijkstra's algorithm</a>: use VW in place
of P(V)+VW in the description above, and the MST will be the set of pointers.
</p>

<h2><a id="travelling">The travelling salesman</a></h2>


<p>
"The travelling salesman" is an old problem about the following hypothetical
situation: A travelling salesman wants to visit a number of cities. There
are flights between every pair of cities, but they have different costs. He
wants to visit all the cities exactly once and finish where he started, with
the minimum cost. This could be paraphrased in graph theory terms as
follows: Find the minimum Hamiltonian cycle of a complete graph.
</p>

<p>
This problem is one of a large class of problems that have frustrated
computer scientists for many years, known as the NP Complete problems.
There might be a way to solve any NP Complete problem in polynomial
time, but nobody has been able to find one. On the other hand, it might
be theoretically impossible to find an algorithm that runs in
polynomial time, but nobody has been able to prove it. I'm going to
outline a few techniques for getting good approximations for this type
of problem (technically NP Complete problems are actually Yes/No
problems; the optimisation variants are known as NP Hard).
</p>

<p>
In an olympiad, you shouldn't be satisfied with any approximation you get,
unless you know it is optimal. You should try to use all the time your
program is allowed to find a better answer. You can just start with an
exhaustive search that you run for as long as possible and then give your
best result yet. However, it is usually possible to structure your program
to avoid checking many options that you know are going to be worse than the
best solution you already have. For example, in the travelling salesman
problem, if the distance you have travelled so far plus the distance to go
directly to the finish is greater than the best result you have so far,
there is no point in continuing. To get the most out of this, you should try
to get a reasonably good estimate before starting the exhausting search. You
can do this is several ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a "smart" algorithm that makes invalid but reasonably accurate
assumptions about the solutions. For example, in the travelling salesman you
could make the salesman always choose the cheapest flight at each step.</li>
<li>Make a few (say 1000) guesses using random numbers.</li>
<li>Any other way that you can think of.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have a travelling salesman problem with the added information that it
is always cheaper to fly direct than going via another city, then there is a
smart algorithm that will always give you at most double the optimal cost:
