<h1>1.8. Queues</h1>

<hr />
<h2><a id="what">What is a queue?</a></h2>


<p>
A queue is a data structure that takes its name from a physical queue, such
as at a supermarket. Items are inserted into a queue at one end and removed
at the other. This principle is often referred to as <em>FIFO</em> (which
stands for <em>First In First Out</em>) because the first item into the
queue is the first one out.

<h2><a id="use">What's it for?</a></h2>


<p>
A queue is essential to any <a
href="../algorithms/graphs.html#shortest">breadth first search</a>. It can
also be used to simulate things like a printer queue that operates on a
"first come, first serve" basis.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>


<p>
There are a number of ways of implementating queues. One method that is
fairly efficient is a <a href="circular.html">circular queue</a>. A slightly
easier method is a <a href="bulkmove.html">bulk move queue</a>. I sometimes
use my own variety, in which I split the queue into two parts with an array
for each. I remove items from the one and add to the other, and when the one
I'm removing from is empty I swap the two. A queues can also be implemented
as a linked list, but this isn't usually a good idea.
