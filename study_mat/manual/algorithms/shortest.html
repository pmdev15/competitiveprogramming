<h1>2.7. Shortest path</h1>

<p>
One of the most basic and common problems in graph theory is to
establish the shortest route between two nodes. In many cases the
graph itself is not obvious. For example the problem may require the
quickest way of solving a puzzle like Rubik's Cube. In this case the
nodes are states and the edges are valid transitions.

<h2><a id="floyd">Floyd's Algorithm</a></h2>


<p>
Floyd's Algorithm solves a slightly different problem: it computes the
minimum distance between <em>every</em> pair of nodes, without
computing the routes themselves. What is particularly nice about
Floyd's algorithm is that it very simple and very efficient, so even if
you only need the distance between a few pairs of nodes, it may still
be useful.
Unfortunately while Floyd's algorithm is simple to remember and
implement, it is not at all clear why it works. I'm going to state the
algorithm, then attempt to explain it. However it's sometimes best just
to go away and think about it, and maybe try a few examples yourself.
</p>

<p>
Floyd's algorithm is best stated in code. The array <code>adj</code> is
initialised to the adjacency matrix of distances (INF being a large
constant meaning no edge), and it is modified <em>in place</em> to
become the matrix of shortest distances.
</p>
<pre>
for y := 1 to N do
  for x := 1 to N do
    if adj[x][y] &lt;&gt; INF then
      for z := 1 to N do
        if (adj[y][z] &lt;&gt; INF) and (adj[x][y] + adj[y][z] &lt; adj[x][z]) then
          adj[x][z] := adj[x][y] + adj[y][z];
</pre>
<p>
As one can see, the inner loop is extremely tight. It is also extremely
important that the order of the loops is correct.
</p>
<p>
To explain the algorithm, one needs to introduce notation. Let [X, Y,
Q] represent the shortest distance from X to Y, using intermediate
nodes 1, 2, ... Q only, taking the value INF if no such path exists.
Floyd's algorithm is based on the observations that
</p>
<pre>
[X, Z, 0] = adj[X][Z]
[X, Z, Y] = min([X, Z, Y - 1], [X, Y, Y - 1] + [Y, Z, Y - 1])
[X, Z, N] = shortest path(X->Z)
</pre>
<p>
At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, <code>adj[X][Z]</code>
represents [X, Z, Y - 1] for the particular value of Y used in the
loop; at the end, it represents [X, Z, Y]. Looking closely at the
loop you may notice some ordering conflicts: the values
<code>adj[x][y]</code> and <code>adj[y][z]</code> may in fact represent
[X, Y, Y] and [Y, Z, Y]. However it is easy to see that [X, Y, Y] = [X,
Y, Y - 1] and [Y, Z, Y] = [Y, Z, Y - 1] so this does not make a
difference.
</p>

<p>
There are two other things worth noticing about Floyd's algorithm. The
first is that it makes no assumptions about symmetry; it works
perfectly well on directed graphs. The second is that apart from giving
you shortest paths, it also tells you which paths exist at all. A very
slight modification of the algorithm gives you Warshall's algorithm for
determining precisely this (known as transitive closure). In fact the
algorithms are so similar that they are often referred to as "the
Floyd-Warshall algorithm".
</p>

<p>
Finally, one should consider the efficiency of Floyd's algorithm: this
is very easy since there are three nested loops from 1 to N, so the
efficiency is clearly O(N<sup>3</sup>). It is tempting to think that it
is more efficient for sparse graphs, because of the first
<code>if</code> test. However as the algorithm progresses, the
<code>adj</code> array rapidly becomes populated, so the
<code>if</code> test has little effect on big-O time. What big-O
analysis doesn't reveal is that the constant factor is very small.
In practical situations Floyd's algorithm may still be faster on sparse
graphs than algorithms that have better theoretical performance.

<h2><a id="dijkstra">Dijkstra's algorithm</a></h2>


<p>
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between a specific node
and all other nodes. This seems to be unnecessarily wasteful (only one
target is required), but in fact the extra information comes for free).
</p>

<p>
While the algorithm is running, the nodes are divided into three sets: the
nodes that we are busy processing, the nodes we have finished processing
and the nodes we haven't considered yet. All the nodes we are busy processing
sit in a <a href="../structures/priority.html">priority queue</a>, and the
priority is the length of the best path from A to the node found so far.
Initially A is placed in the priority queue with priority 0. Then the following
process is repeated until we finish processing B (or until the priority queue
is empty, if we want to find the shortest path to all other nodes). P(X) is
the priority of node X and XY is the length of edge XY.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Pop the node with the lowest priority off the priority queue.
Call this node V. P(V) is the length of the shortest path from
A to V.</li>
<li>Mark V as finished processing.</li>
<li>Loop through all of V's neighbours that we haven't finished processing. Say
W is the current neighbour being considered.</li>
<li>If W isn't in the priority queue yet or it is but has a priority higher than
P(V)+VW then
<ul><li>set W's priority to P(V)+VW, and add it to the priority queue if
necessary.</li>
    <li>Store a pointer from W to V (e.g. have an array called prev, and set
prev[W] to V).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The length of the path to B is P(B). To construct the path itself, follow
the stored pointers from B: they form a shortest path going back to A. It is
sometimes convenient to apply the algorithm from B to A instead of from A to
B, since the path itself then comes out from A to B instead of from B to A.
</p>

<p>The algorithm doesn't specify how to implement the priority queue. Using
a <a href="../structures/heap.html">heap</a> results in an O((E+V)log V)
algorithm which is good for sparse graphs, while using an unsorted list
results in an O(V<sup>2</sup>) algorithm which is better for dense graphs.</p>

<p>Note that if the graph is unweighted, then the priority queue can be
replaced by a regular <a href="../structures/queue.html">queue</a> and this
will be more efficient.</p>
